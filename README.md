# TapCounter ‚è¨
- I developed this app in order to practice the hooks in React Native
- Basically I first used the old way to writhe the state changes, then I did a refactoring with the useState
- The result was awesome, 20 lines of code just gone because of the hook
- I also aim to use styled components in this app, just for practice
